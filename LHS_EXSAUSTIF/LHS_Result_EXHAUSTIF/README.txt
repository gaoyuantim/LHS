

	We totally realized the results from 2 to 5 dimensions. 

		dimensions	points
		  
		    2		 3-14

		    3		 3-7

		    4		 3-7

		    5		 3-5

	In each result text, we have several parts of informations.


	Example:

	Title : LHS_3_2_EXHAUSTIF

		/*The result when there are n = 3 points in a m = 2 dimensions space by exhaustif methode*/


		[TRUE, 0.001048,06/07/2016]

		/*[the result is optimal or not, time, date]*/


		0	0
		1	2
		2	1

		/*the result table*/


		2	1
		5	2

		/*if the result is optimal, we will have the second table in text. The first colone means the distance between each pair of points, the second colone means the number*/
