# LHS-Maximin

This repository provides several programs by some methods in order to
improve Latin Hypercube Sampling by criteria of maximin.  Totally,
this repository includes 4 different points of views to solve the
problem. For example:

* Method of iteration
  * In this method, the program check all the possibilities to find
    out the results, you can check it in the folder: LHS_EXAUSTIF
* Method of testing distance
  * Generally when we have got the maximin distance, we can try to
    detect the result directly. In the folder: LHS_D2TEST
* Method of sum combination
  * When the number of dimension >= number of points, the maximin
    distance is close to the theoretical limit. In the folder: LHS_SUM
* Method of checking bound
  * When the number of points and dimensions are too big to find out
    the result, the repository provides a method to find out the
    bound. In the folder: LHS_BOUND

## Requirements

You need an interpreter of the Matlab/Octave langage, that is, either
Mathworks's [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/
"Matlab") or [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "GNU
Octave").

The results presented in the repository were obtained using Matlab
R2015a on a computer equipped with Inter i7 3.4GHZ and RAM
16g. Besides, youâ€™d better pay attention to your version of visual
studio, which should match well with Matlab version.

## Installation

Simply run init.m to compile all the MEX-files and add subdirectories
to the path.
